# Exporting to Illustrator

- Use the [Processing PDF Library](http://processing.org/reference/libraries/pdf/)

# Exporting Tips

- Read the docs!
- Release the Clipping Path
- Content outside your window __is__ exported.
- Focus on having Processing output the parts of your design that would be hard to create in Illustrator (the data, not the legend).
- You can recolor, distort, scale, position and otherwise manipulate your generated shapes in Processing.

- Pathfinder and Align palettes
- Select Same tools
- Edit Colors tools
