# Many Types of Data Visualizations Exist

[D3 Gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)

---

## Which Kind Should I Use?

- What kind of data do you have?
- What do you want to show about your data?

---

## Should I Follow the Rules?

- Many forms of data graphics have well established conventions.
- Following conventions makes it easier for you to express data.
- Following conventions makes it easier for your audience to interpret data.
- Not following conventions can confuse and mislead.
- Conventions may not be well suited to your data.

---

## Should I Invent a New Kind of Graph?

- Yes, you can create a visualization that perfectly fits both the data you have, and what you want to communicate about it.
- No, the stantard visualizatons have been refined and battle-tested.
- No, people won't already know how to read your visualization.
